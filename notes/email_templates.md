# Template: Speaker Confirmation

Thanks for completing the call for presenters. 

Based on your form, the day that works best for you to present your work is ... Would you be interested in filling that slot? 

If so, then I will need a title, an abstract, and a photo for the seminar poster. You will also need to provide a draft of the slides or the paper to a discussant at least 1 week in advance. And, I would like to provide a quick 1-2 paragraph intro for speakers. Can you please provide me a CV or point me to your website so I can create this narrative?

As for the discussant, I would like to match you with someone who is working on XXX economics or the subject of your TBD paper. Could you please suggest 2 or 3 names of students in our department who could provide you some decent feedback?

# Template: Disscussant Request

I am organizing the APEC Student Seminar Series. As part of the series, each presenter will be matched with a discussant who can provide critical feedback on their work. The discussant is to speak after the presenter and before the general Q/A section of the seminar. 

Would you be willing to act as a discussant for XXX on XXX? This involves creating a brief 10 minute slide deck re-capping the paper, identifying the main contributions, and identifying the main issues/concerns with the paper for constructive criticism.

Are​ you interested and available to provide a 1-hour workshop on this topic for the graduate students? If you are interested, the following are the dates which would be available on Wednesdays from 2-3pm CT on campus in Ruttan 232. Can you let me know which ones work for you so I can slot you into the schedule?
