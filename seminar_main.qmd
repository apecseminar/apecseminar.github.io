# Description: 

The [Applied Economics Student Seminar Series](https://apecseminar.github.io/) presents applied economics research hosted by the University of Minnesota. 
Speakers are primarly current and former students of the graduate program for Applied Economics at Minnesota. 
Additionally, we feature other students in adjacent department of Economics, Business, Public Health, and Public Policy whose work has an applied focus.
As such, it is a forum for early career researchers to get feedback on their work at varying stages. 
This includes preliminary results to polished job market papers. 
The APEC Student Seminar Series has a storied tradition within the department dating back to 2019 -- providing community and comradery amongst the graduate student body.
