# About 

This will be a small, informal group where we can come together to discuss our interests in behavioral economics, exchange ideas, and build a supportive academic community.

# Meetings

The first session will be an introductory meeting where we can get to know one another and collectively decide on the format and focus for future seminars. Whether you're interested in presenting your research, discussing recent papers, or simply listening and learning, we welcome your participation.

# Join the Group

If you are interested in joining the group, you can reach out directly to Uma Parasuram in the Applied Economics department.
