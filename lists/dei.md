# Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI)

This is a page of resources related to DEI for the Applied Economics program at the University of Minnesota. 
The current DEI student representative is [SongYi Paik](https://www.songyipaik.com/). 
The current Diversity & Inclusion Committee Chair is [Dr. Hikaru Peterson](https://apec.umn.edu/people/hikaru-peterson). 
Concerns related to DEI at the department level are addressed via the Diversity Equity and Inclusion Committee.
The department's resources and stance on DEI may be found through the [APEC Website](https://apec.umn.edu/dei).
More broadly, the University of Minnesota has an [Office of Equity and Diversity](https://diversity.umn.edu/) with resources and support on DEI-related material.
Graduate students can use the [Graduate Student Resource Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15zb9IlSKAt7K7rg-pC_QvTFvQvC6yvqU7jLLIgr616E/edit) to find UMN based graduate resources to support them. 


## International Student Resources
The current International Student Representative is [Joseph Aguilar Bohorquez](https://apec.umn.edu/people/joseph-aguilar-bohorquez). 
Many students find the [Councile of International Graduate Students (CIGS)](https://sites.google.com/umn.edu/cigsumn/home) to be a helpful resource on campus. 
Here is a list of [Identity-based Organizations](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VCv9dexgtS7v8h-3IoFeX38KX5AirxVIKdhb3THfzVI/edit#gid=1174195306) at UMN for graduate students.
