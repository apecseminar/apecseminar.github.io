# Labs and Working Groups   

In the applied economics (APEC) department, there are several lab groups that you can join based on your fields of interest. 
For most groups, you will need to reach out to the professor who runs the lab group. 
There are also several labs and working groups adjacent to the deparment that may be of interest to graduate students.
