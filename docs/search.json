You will also need to provide a draft of the slides or the paper to a discussant at least 1 week in advance. And, I would like to provide a quick 1-2 paragraph intro for speakers. Can you please provide me a CV or point me to your website so I can create this narrative?\nAs for the discussant, I would like to match you with someone who is working on XXX economics or the subject of your TBD paper. Could you please suggest 2 or 3 names of students in our department who could provide you some decent feedback?\n\n\nTemplate: Disscussant Request\nI am organizing the APEC Student Seminar Series. As part of the series, each presenter will be matched with a discussant who can provide critical feedback on their work. The discussant is to speak after the presenter and before the general Q/A section of the seminar.\nWould you be willing to act as a discussant for XXX on XXX? This involves creating a brief 10 minute slide deck re-capping the paper, identifying the main contributions, and identifying the main issues/concerns with the paper for constructive criticism.\n\n\nTemplate: Skill Series Request\nThis semester I will be organizing a skill series for graduate students to build on skills that often are not taught in the classroom. These are skills that graduate students have requested be discussed in through a workshop format.\n​I would like for you to present a session on “Covariate Selection and the Doubly Robust Estimator​”. Are​ you interested and available to provide a 1-hour workshop on this topic for the graduate students? If you are interested, the following are the dates which would be available on Wednesdays from 2-3pm CT on campus in Ruttan 232. Can you let me know which ones work for you so I can slot you into the schedule?\nSept. 13th Sept. 27th Oct. 12th Oct. 26th Nov. 9th Nov. 23rd Dec. 7th\nAs part of the skill series, I am hoping to make posters to advertise the event. Would you be willing to provide a photo that would be okay to share on this poster?\n\n\nTemplate: Future Speaker\nWould you be willing to present your work next semester for the Spring series?"
